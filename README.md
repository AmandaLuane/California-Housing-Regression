# California Housing Regression

This repository contains Python code for predicting median house values in California communities using various regression techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison to find the best model for predicting housing prices.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this analysis is from the 1990 census and includes various features such as median income, house age, average rooms, average bedrooms, population, and more. The target variable is the median house value.

## Code Overview

The Python code provided here performs the following tasks:

1. Loading and preprocessing the California housing dataset.
2. Training a linear regression model and evaluating its performance on training and test sets.
3. Training a Lasso regression model and comparing its performance with the linear regression model.
4. Training a Ridge regression model and comparing its performance with the linear regression model.
5. Visualizing RMSE values and coefficients of different models.
6. Analyzing and comparing the coefficients, RMSE values, and predicted values of the models.
